# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
INTRODUCTION:
Diabetic is the medical disorder that impact how
well our body uses food as fuel, most of the food
we eat daily is converted into sugar,
Diabetes can cause blood sugar levels to rise if it is
not continuously and carefully managed, which
raises the chance of severe side effects like heart
attack and stroke.Therefore,I choose to
forecast using Python machine learning.

OBJECTIVE:
I will be predicting that whether the
patient has diabetes or not on the basis
of the features we will provide to our
machine learning model
